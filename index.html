        <p>Chickens are often just seen as food but are actually very intelligent.  They are able to recognize up to 100 faces, animal or human alike!

    <div class="info">
        <p>The term "pecking order" comes from the heirarchy chickens utilize for social organization.  They literally peck one another in a show of strength.  The stronger, more dominant chickens will ascend to the top of the pecking order whereas the weaker will be at the bottom and often will run away. </p>
